           <p>I recently installed a debian package that left apt-get in a very bad state. Whenever I tried to upgrade or install a package I received the following error.</p>
<blockquote><p>% sudo apt-get upgrade<br>
Reading package lists… Done<br>
Building dependency tree… Done<br>
E: The package jedit needs to be reinstalled, but I can’t find an archive for it.</p></blockquote>
<p>If I tried to uninstall the package I would get the following.</p>
<blockquote><p>% sudo dpkg –remove jedit<br>
dpkg: error processing jedit (–remove):<br>
Package is in a very bad inconsistent state – you should<br>
reinstall it before attempting a removal.<br>
Errors were encountered while processing: jedit</p></blockquote>
<p>The only way I was able to get the package manager working properly was to run</p>
<blockquote><p>% sudo dpkg –force-remove-reinstreq –remove jedit<br>
dpkg – warning, overriding problem because –force enabled:<br>
Package is in a very bad inconsistent state – you should<br>
reinstall it before attempting a removal.<br>
(Reading database …<br>
dpkg: serious warning: files list file for package `jedit’ missing, assuming package has no files currently installed.<br>
107365 files and directories currently installed.)<br>
Removing jedit …</p></blockquote>
