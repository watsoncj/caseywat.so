<p>Here is an example of brute force engine searching. It does nothing more than perform a large number of searches in a very short time. Beware this is not a very nice thing to do and it is a terrible waste of network, and CPU resources. This is given as an example of the   power of cURL. This script is written in PHP and uses the libcurl libraries.<br>
[code lang="php"]<br>
<!--?php<br /-->
$base_url = "http://www.google.com/search";<br>
$ch = curl_init();</p>
<p>for($i=0; $i&lt;20; $i++) {<br>
  $url = $base_url . "?q=$i";<br>
  curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $url);<br>
  curl_exec($ch);<br>
}</p>
<p>curl_close($ch);<br>
?&gt;<br>
