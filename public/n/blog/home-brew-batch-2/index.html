           <p>I just finished my second batch of home-brew. This one was a Porter that turned out to be pretty delicious.</p>
<p>I’ve posted a few <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081119095336/http://picasaweb.google.com/watsoncj/HomeBrew">pictures</a>. And for those who are interested, I’ve also posted the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081119095336/http://casedogdesigns.com/homebrew/porter-recipe.pdf" target="_blank">recipe</a>.</p>
