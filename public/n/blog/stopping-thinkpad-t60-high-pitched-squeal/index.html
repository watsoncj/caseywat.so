                                       <p>After installing Ubuntu on my T60, I realized it was making this annoying, extremely high-pitched squeal. I found that it only squealed when it wasn’t plugged into the wall. After Googling a bit I found that I could stop it by setting the <em>max_cstate</em>. I think that this has to do with the CPU’s power consumption. At lower consumption levels it emits the squeal.</p>
                                       <p>Anyhow, running the following command seemed to stop the screeching. The default is 8.</p>
                                       <blockquote><p>echo 2 &gt; /sys/module/processor/parameters/max_cstate</p></blockquote>
