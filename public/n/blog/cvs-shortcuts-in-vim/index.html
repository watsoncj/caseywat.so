           <div class="entrytext">
           <p>Vim is an incredibly flexible text editor. I continue to be surprised by the number of strange things it’s capable of doing. For example, there is a crude Tetris clone available for Vim.</p>
<p>A bit more useful, though, is the cvsmenu script for Vim. This is a fairly polished plug-in that will allow you to do all of the basic CVS tasks from inside your text editor. The supported CVS commands are: add, diff, commit, update, status, shortstatus, localstatus, and revertchanges.</p>
<p>Since the plug-in is poorly documented, I thought that I would take this opportunity to explain how to use it.</p>
<p><strong>Installation</strong></p>
<p>In Ubuntu, this is pretty simple.</p>
<blockquote><p>% sudo aptitude install vim-scripts</p>
<p>% vim-addons install cvsmenu</p></blockquote>
<p>This will install the package and enable the plugin for your user.</p>
<p><strong>Usage</strong></p>
<p>I will assume that you already have a versioned source tree checked out on your system. Start by opening a file in this tree. You can open a diff view by typing “,cd”. <em>Note: that’s comma, C, D.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090106071332/http://casedogdesigns.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/cvs-diff.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-29" title="cvs-diff" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20090106071332im_/http://casedogdesigns.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/cvs-diff-300x166.png" alt="" width="300" height="166"></a></p>
<p style="clear:left;">
</p><p>The local revision is shown on the right, the remote revision is on the left. This is a bit backwards from the Eclipse and Netbeans way of doing things. Typing CTRL+W+W will move your cursor between the two revisions. <em>I haven’t found an easy way to move a change to the right, but I would be interested in reader comments.</em></p>
<p>Here is an index of the commands. They may be documentation somewhere but I was only able to find them by looking at the plug-in source code.</p>
<ul>
<li>,ca - Add</li>
<li>,cd - Diff</li>
<li>,ci - Commit</li>
<li>,cu - Update</li>
<li>,cs - Status</li>
<li>,ch - Short Status</li>
<li>,cc - Local Status</li>
<li>,cv - Revert Local Changes. The odd thing about this is that it only updates the file on disk. It doesn’t actually revert the changes in the open editor.</li>
</ul>
<p>Modern IDEs do ease the pain of performing mundane versioning tasks such as merging. But, this is a nice alternative to those heavy-weight tools.</p>
