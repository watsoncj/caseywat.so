                                 <p>Ubuntu has made it extremely easy to install the Sun Java Development Environment. This is good, because the default java-gcj is very slow.</p>
                                 <p>First install the package with: <strong>sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jdk</strong></p>
                                 <p>That may take a while since the package is 125MB. Once it is installed, you still need to make it the default:</p>
                                 <p><strong>sudo update-java-alternatives -s java-6-sun</strong></p>
