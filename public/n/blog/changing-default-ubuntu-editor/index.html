                                 <p>I’ve gotten tired of being presented with the default nano text editor every time I go to write a subversion commit comment or when I run visudo. So I finally figured out how to change the default text editor from nano.</p>
                                 <blockquote><p>% sudo update-alternatives –config editor</p></blockquote>
                                 <p>I personally prefer good old vim!</p>
