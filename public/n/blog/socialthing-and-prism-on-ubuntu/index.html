           <p>A <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080820022040/http://blog.socialthing.com/2008/05/26/socialthing-logo-for-site-specific-browsers/">recent article on the socialthing! blog</a> made me curious about setting up a site specific browser in Ubuntu.</p>
<p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080820022040/http://casedogdesigns.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/socialthing.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-26" title="socialthing" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20080820022040im_/http://casedogdesigns.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/socialthing-300x205.png" alt="" width="300" height="205"></a></p>
<p style="clear: left">This is a pretty simple thing to accomplish and it beats the heck out of the currently available Ubuntu twitter clients.</p>
<p>Start by installing the prism package.</p>
<blockquote><p><font style="position: absolute;overflow: hidden;height: 0;width: 0"><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080820022040/http://kvantservice.com/">компютри</a></font>sudo aptitude install prism</p></blockquote>
<p>You can then setup a new application by starting prism either from the command line or from the applications menu. Setup is pretty self-explanitory but here is a screenshot for good measure.</p>

<p style="clear: left">If your looking for a good socialthing! icon, you can find one <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080820022040/http://blog.socialthing.com/2008/05/26/socialthing-logo-for-site-specific-browsers/">here</a>. Then launch your new app and voila!</p>
<p>You might also checkout prism-facebook, prism-google-mail, prism-google-reader, and prism-twitter.</p>
