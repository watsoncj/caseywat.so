           <div class="entrytext">
           <p>On Tuesday, Eclipse told me it had updates (3.3.2) available.  For the<br>
next three days I got 404/503 errors from the mirror sites it tried to<br>
use.  I finally got it updated today and learned that they fixed<br>
whatever was keeping DBEdit from working.  So if Eclipse’s Database<br>
Development views annoy you as much as me, upgrade when you get a<br>
chance.<br>
<span id="more-18"></span><br>
The difference between DBEdit and Eclipse’s take is quite telling.  The<br>
Eclipse one tends to information overload, showing you every possible<br>
facet of the database you might want to look into.  DBEdit tends to ease<br>
<strike> of</strike> use, making it easy to query and edit the contents of tables.<br>
Navigating to a table in Eclipse requires right-click-to-connect, then<br>
about seven levels of tree expansion.</p>
<p>DBEdit connects on double click and then provides tables at most three<br>
levels deep.  You can double click on a table to see the data in the<br>
table and can browse all the data.  You don’t have to switch between<br>
tabs after running every query.  It doesn’t prompt you to save your SQL<br>
queries when you run a program.  DBEdit is a good example of<br>
user-centered design.  Focus on a specific problem (examining database<br>
contents) and make it easy for the user to solve that problem.<br>
Eclipse’s database tools are an example of model-focused design.  Figure<br>
out all of the parts of the domain and create a user interface that<br>
follows that model.  I’m sure there are things that the Database<br>
Development perspective can do that DBEdit can’t, but those are things I<br>
usually don’t want to do.</p>
<p>(Caveat: I haven’t played with Database Development Tools in 3.3.2, so<br>
some of the UI quirks may have improved.  But the interface<br>
fundamentally makes it hard for me to do what I usually want to do.)</p>
