           <p>Prototype has gotten a new home in the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090106130430/http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/cppsu/index.html">Pragmatic Bookshelf</a>. This book has a wealth of information about both Prototype and script.aculo.us. It comes complete with many code examples. Though it is still in it’s early stages, I expect it be to a high quality read just like the other Pragmatic Books.</p>
