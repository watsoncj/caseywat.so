           <div class="entrytext">
           <p>I was just reading the Ubuntu development process documentation. In particular the document on <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090106134232/https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TimeBasedReleases">Time Based Releases</a>.</p>
<p>I think they really hit the nail on the head with this one. This quote caught my attention:</p>
<blockquote><p>The overall quality and punctuality of an Ubuntu release are more important than any single feature, and a high-quality feature is superior to a hastily-added one, even if it arrives in a later release. Free software developers are passionate about their work, and it is easy to get carried away by a particular feature, losing sight of the greater goals of Ubuntu. Pause, breathe, and consider whether it is more important to get it <em>now</em> or to get it <em>right</em>.</p></blockquote>
<p>I couldn’t have said it any better myself. Feature creep is difficult to avoid. When trying to deliver a release it seems that issues keep getting added to the pile. Eventually, the release has taken three times longer to get out the door than initially planned.</p>
<p>Software development needs to be flexible and respond to changes as they arise, but it seems like setting some hard deadlines can go a long way towards delivering useful software.</p>
