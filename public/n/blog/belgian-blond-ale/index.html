           <div class="entrytext">
           <p>Last weekend I brewed up a 5 gallon batch of my first belgian style ale. This is an extract recipe with a small amount of specialty grains.</p>
<p>The BJCP describes this style as <em>“A moderate-strength golden ale that has a subtle Belgian complexity, slightly sweet flavor, and dry finish.” </em></p>
<p>I am eager to see how it turns out.</p>
<p><a style="float: left;" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090627051957/http://casedogdesigns.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/belgian-blond.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-70" title="Belgian Blond" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20090627051957im_/http://casedogdesigns.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/belgian-blond-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300"></a></p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
<li>0.74 lbs. Balgian Pale</li>
<li>0.10 lbs. Belgian Aromatic</li>
<li>3 lbs. Dry Extra Light Extract<br>
Boiled at 25 min.</li>
<li>3 lbs. Muntons Dry Extra Light Extract<br>
Boiled at 25 min.</li>
<li>.6 lbs. Candi Sugar Clear</li>
<li>1 oz Challenger (Pellets, 6.7%AA)<br>
Boiled at 60 min.</li>
<li>.4 oz Amarillo (Pellets, 8%AA)<br>
Boiled at 15 min.</li>
<li>.5 oz Fuggle (Pellets, 4.75%AA)<br>
Boiled at 1 min.</li>
</ul>
<p style="clear: left;">Once again, I forgot to measure the original gravity. The recipe that I started with predicted an OG of 1.066 with an expected alcohol content of 7.3%.</p>
