           <p>I was amazed to see how simple Perl makes it to read the lines of a file into an array.</p>
<blockquote><p>#!/usr/bin/perl<br>
open(I, “flavors.txt”);<br>
@flavors = &lt;I&gt;;</p></blockquote>
<p>With just two lines of code, you are ready to do some string munching. You can then run through the elements in the array with a loop similar to the following.</p>
<blockquote><p>for($i=0; $i&lt;@flavors.length; $i++) {<br>
@flavors[i] =~ s/•//;<br>
}</p></blockquote>
<p>I would enjoy seeing some other ways to iterate through the array.</p>
